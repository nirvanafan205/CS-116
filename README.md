# CS-116

This course introduces the discipline of computer science using a high-level programming language such as C++ and utilizing programming and practical hands-on problem solving. Students learn the fundamental concepts of programming by applying lecture content to practical hands-on problem solving laboratory activities. Students design, implement, test, and debug computer programs using top-down, structured programming techniques. Students examine program planning techniques, expressions, selection, repetition, arrays, data structures, functions, parameter passing, and file and interactive input/output. Intended as a first course in computer science. This course is required for computer information systems and computer science majors; and is desirable for students wishing to study programming.
